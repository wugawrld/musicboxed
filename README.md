# MusicBoxed Web App !

This app was simply a passion project that attempted to allow users to comment on various trending albums anonymously, along with exposing users to other trending songs/albums! I used TypeScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB to create an intuitive yet simple UI, and an efficent and reliable backend respectively.

The Spotify API was used to both provide users with an emdedded player (a later decision that replaced a custom component) to listen to songs straight from Spotify, along with providing up-to-date information on artists, albums, and streams.

# Homepage 

The homepage was designed to be simplistic and accessible, showcasing the embedded player at the top right below the navbar, along with the album carousel underneath it.

# Functionality

Users simply have to click on the album they want to leave a comment on, prompting the opening of a comment menu and archive; after typing a comment they hit post and the comment is stored in a MongoDB database for storage and retrieval.

Different albums all hold different comments, and accesssing the comment and archive functionality is as simple as clicking on the album they wish to view.
